# Investigating-plane-accidents

In this project, I will be working with a data set containing 77,282 aviation accidents that occured in the U.S., and the metadata associated with them. The data is stored in the `AviationData.txt` file coming from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).

I'm going to walkthrough this project by:
1. Cleaning the data.
2. Using functions to:
  2a. Search for a string like "LAX94LA336" through rows.
  2b. Create a hash table a search for the "LAX9LA336" again, the goal is to compare time complexity between methodes 2a and 2b. 
  2c. Investigate the states where most accidents occured.
  2d. Calculate the amount of falalities and serious injuries by month.
  2e. Calculate the worst air carriers.
  2f. Find the biggest percentages of accidents occuring in adverse weather conditions.
